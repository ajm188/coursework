    It may be beneficial to overfit if you know that real data will have about
    the same distribution as the training data. That is, the closer the
    training data is to ``real world'' data, the more beneficial overfitting
    is. The reason to avoid overfitting is to prevent the model from performing
    poorly later due to high variance between the training data and real
    samples. However, if there is no (or little) variance, then an overfit
    model will perform extremely well both in evaluation and on real samples.\\
