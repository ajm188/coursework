Compiling and Running Code
(see the Makefile for more information)

$ make
This will compile the AstarAgent code and then run sepia using the maze_8x8_config.xml file

$ make config *.xml
This will complie the AstarAgent code and then run sepia using the maze config file specified.
Only provide the name of the file, not the relative path, since the Makefile assumes the config file lives in data/
Example (same as running $ make): $ make config maze_8x8_config.xml

$ make agent
This will compile the AstarAgent code and do nothing else
